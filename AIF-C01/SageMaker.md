# SageMaker

A fully managed service that provides everything needed to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.

## Deployment Options
- **Real-Time**: Provides near-instant predictions.
- **Serverless**: Ideal for short-term inference that can handle occasional cold starts.
- **Asynchronous**: Supports payloads up to 1GB and can process longer-running tasks.
- **Batch**: Used for large-scale, offline bulk processing of datasets.

## SageMaker Studio
An integrated development environment (IDE) with a graphical interface for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

## Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)
A feature that automatically tunes models by selecting the best hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## SM Data Wrangler

A component of SageMaker that enables you to prepare, transform, and analyze data for machine learning.

## SM Feature Store

A centralized repository for storing and managing features from multiple data sources (including Data Wrangler).

## SM Clarify

A component of SageMaker that evaluates the performance of foundation models. Clarify also provides insights into how a model makes its predictions. Additionally, it can detect biases in models and datasets.

## SM Ground Truth

A component of SageMaker that utilizes Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which incorporates human feedback into the learning reward function.

### Ground Truth Plus

A feature within Ground Truth designed for labeling data.

## SM Model Cards

A standarized format for providing documentation of models.

## SM Model Dashboard

Show all of your models that are deployed in one place.

## SM Role Manager

Allows you to define roles for specific users: engineers or data scientisits.

## Model Monitor

Allows you to monitor the quality of your models in production.

## SageMaker Pipeline

Basically AWS CodePipeline but for building ML models. CI/CD.

## SageMaker JumpStart

Pre-trained ML models on SageMaker.

## SageMaker Canvas

SageMaker's no code solution for building ML models.

## MLFlow on SageMaker

A tool that helps teams manage their entire ML lifecycle.
